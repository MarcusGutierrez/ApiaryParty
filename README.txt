ApiaryParty is a network security game developed using Java 8 but will most likely also work for Java 7

To build and execute this code you can do two things:
1. Use ant by simply typing the command "ant" (without quotes) in the command line (ant needs to be installed http://ant.apache.org/)
	If the output is too long ant will only show the first part of it.
	To manually run the compiled jar type "java -jar build/jar/ApiaryParty.jar"
2. Import the code to your favorite IDE and execute it that way

To build JavaDoc:
1. Use ant by typing the command "ant doc"
2. Use your favorite IDE to generate the JavaDoc (use a search engine if you do not know how to do this).

HINT:
When creating your agents get creative. Use what you have learned in class. Look up other topics that might help.
Do something smart with your agents. Turning in an improved benchmark agent will likely not do well.
Try making multiple versions of different attackers and defenders.
